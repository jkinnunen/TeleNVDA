This release brings the following changes:

* Added a new gesture (unassigned by default) to report how many computers are connected to a remote session.
* The add-on should be able to run from scratchpad without errors.
* Added a rate limiting feature for the direct connection server, originally proposed by @codeofdusk on NVDA Remote.
* Use `time.monotonic` instead of `time.time` to prevent the future 2038 effect.
* Updated translations.
